## Description
This Python project is a simple, text-based version of the classic game Battleship. The game is played against the computer in a 5x5 grid. Players take turns to guess the location of the enemy's ships and try to sink them all to win the game.

## Features
- Two boards: one for the player and one for the computer.
- Random placement of ships on the board.
- Turn-based gameplay allowing the player and the computer to guess ship locations.
- Real-time hit/miss feedback with each guess.
- Victory condition check after each turn.

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your name when prompted.

3. You will see your board with your ships (marked as 'S') and the hits or misses.
4. Enter the row and column numbers to hit a spot on the computer's board.
5. The game will indicate whether it was a hit or a miss.
6. The game ends when all ships on one board are sunk.

## Installation
No additional libraries are required to run this game. Just ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Limitations
- The game currently does not have a graphical interface; it runs in the console.
- There is no difficulty level for the computer player; it makes random guesses.
- Board size and number of ships are fixed and cannot be changed in-game.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a graphical user interface.
- Implementing adjustable difficulty levels.
- Allowing customizable board sizes and number of ships.
